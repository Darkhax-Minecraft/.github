Hello, I am Darkhax and this GitHub organization is home to the source code for many of my Minecraft mods. You can find and download playable versions of these mods from their project pages on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev/projects).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
